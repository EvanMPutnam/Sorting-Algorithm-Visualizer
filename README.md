# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
An application using the processing framework to visualize different sorting algorithms.

Created as a demonstration tool.

### Current Algorithms
* Merge Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort

### Controls
* Number keys swap between the algorithms.
* Space bar resets the data and kicks off the algorithm again.
